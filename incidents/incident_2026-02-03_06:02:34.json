        "title": "Database Connection and Memory Leak",
        "root_cause": "The root cause of the failure is a combination of high memory usage and a refused connection to the database. The server starts with a high memory usage warning at 85%, and then encounters a ConnectionRefusedError when trying to connect to the database at host 10.0.0.5. This leads to a critical database failure and eventually an Out of Memory (OOM) error, causing the process to be killed.",
        "fix": "To fix this issue, increase the server's memory allocation and optimize the database connection settings. Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for the database connection and add memory monitoring to prevent OOM errors. Example code fix: db.connect(host=\"10.0.0.5\", timeout=30, retries=3, backoff_factor=0.5); Add memory monitoring using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to alert on high memory usage."
